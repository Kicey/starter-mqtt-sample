This is a sample to use spring-boot-starter-mqtt write by myself.
Pay attention that the starter now is simple and crude, just can use, and it is not suitable for production environment.
I don't rush to complete it recently.

* The starter don't keep the application alive, so you should that yourself or with web server.
